# RNASeqDataSimulator

RNASeqDataSimulator is a command-line tool written in the Python programming language. 
Its goal is to use publicly available 'real' RNA-sequencing data to build models and extract the statistical characteristics
of the data.The models can then be used to generate synthetic RNA-sequencing data that resembles that of real RNA-seq data. 

The simulator provides a set of tunable parameters that can help to produce sequencing data with various characteristics.
